This readme is to record my learning path to build chrome/edge extensions with Vue, Typescript and VITE. 

The goal is to build a chrome extension to help learn English. When I read news or any posts online and encounter some vocabulary, I would like to add them into some collection and later I should be reminded to review and practice the usage of the vocabulary. I would like to leverage OpenAI to generate practicing problems.
